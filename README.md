## <a name="introduction">🤖 Introduction</a>

A full-stack Next.js project, DevFlow—a community-driven platform inspired by StackOverflow, enhanced with AI-powered answers, gamification, recommendations, and more. Using the latest features of Next.js, you’ll explore rendering strategies like SSG, ISR, SSR, PPR, Server Functions, Caching, & Revalidation to create a production-ready application.

The project uses MongoDB for a robust database layer, NextAuth (Auth.js) for versatile authentication options (Email/Password, GitHub, Google), and sleek styling with TailwindCSS and ShadCN UI. DevFlow enables developers to ask questions, post answers, leverage AI for responses, vote, organize content, contribute, discover jobs, and explore recommended topics—all while engaging with gamified elements like badges and rewards.
